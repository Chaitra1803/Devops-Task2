# Devops-Task2
Setting up Jenkins for Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

Description:

Configure Jenkins to automate the build, test, and deployment processes for your
application.

Test Cases:

1. Integration with Version Control:

Test Case 1: Make a commit to the version control system and verify that Jenkins automatically
triggers a build.

Expected Outcome: Jenkins should detect the new commit and start the CI pipeline
automatically, fetching the latest code changes.

2. Access Control and Permissions:
   
Test Case 2: Restrict access to certain Jenkins jobs or features based on user roles.
Expected Outcome: Users without appropriate permissions should be unable to trigger or
modify Jenkins jobs beyond their assigned privileges.

3. Notification Setup:
   
Test Case 3: Configure email notifications for build status changes (e.g., success, failure,
unstable).

Expected Outcome: Jenkins should send email notifications to designated recipients based on
the outcome of the builds, ensuring timely communication of build statuses.
